##  Store files / upload files for your web site

*  You need to upload files at /var/www/html under RHEL / CentOS / Fedora Linux operating system.


## Apache Server configuration

After installing the web-server package group or the http package, a default configuration is written to /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf (RHEL/Cent OS/Fedora Core Linux) or /etc/apache2/httpd.conf (Debian / Ubuntu Linux). This configuration serves out the contents of /var/w/html for requests coming in to any hostname over plain http. Use a text editor such as vi to edit the configuration file.
